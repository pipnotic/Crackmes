OK, here we are again with a new series of challenges, which will start with number 10. This time, you'll be forced to think out of the box, be creative.

Here are the guidelines:

- Find the number of Nerf darts
- Find the hash
- Generate the valid MD5 like so: MD5(<number of darts>:<valid hash>)
- Enter the MD5 and press the "Unlock" button to decrypt the code
- Press the "Go" button to see if you got it right. If not, the challenge will exit.
- Verify your hash here: http://blog.sat0ri.com/challenges/ten/verify.php?hash=<your hash value>

If you have any questions then post them in the forum at http://blog.sat0ri.com/

Have a blast!

Regards,
sharpe.
