[ CRACKME: Crackme #3 ]
[ DIFFICULTY: Level 2 ]


[ INTRODUCTION ]

This is a relatively easy KeyGenme with a few simple tricks. The crackme does some simple code encryption that destroys the code needed to rip the serial algo. This you need to fix. Once this is done, it should be relatively easy to  rip to serial algo and generate a valid username/serial combination.


[ RULES ]

You must sort out the encryption algo in order to rip the code used to generate valid serials. You are allowed to patch here to restore the original code. After you have done this, you can either write a keygen or find a valid username and serial combination. 


[ CONCLUSION ]

That's it. Have fun and feel free to ask any questions.
