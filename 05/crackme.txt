[ CRACKME: Crackme #5 ]
[ DIFFICULTY: ? ]


[ INTRODUCTION ]

The serial-generation code in this crackme is obfuscated, there are no signatures this time and the entire serial generation code has been re-written. After the unlock code has been found, type it in and it will de-obfuscate the serial generation code. If you enter an invalid code, the crackme will die (depending on your luck of course), as the de-obfuscation routine may very well result in invalid instruction sequences. After this bit has been complete it should be straight forward.


[ RULES ]

- No patching
- Find the correct unlock code
- Write a keygen
- Write a tutorial explaining how you solved this one and please include your code


[ CONCLUSION ]

I don't know how difficult this crackme is, so I would really appreciate your feedback on this, as I would like to put a difficulty level on the final release.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask :o)

Enjoy!

Best,
sharpe
