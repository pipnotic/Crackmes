[ INTRODUCTION ]

This is a relatively easy KeyGenme with a few simple tricks. There are some other things going on
that I shall not describe here, as it is written in ASM and thus pretty easy to read. 


[ RULES ]

This is a KeyGenme so ultimately I'd like to see some cool keygens. If you are unable to do this then
you are also permitted to do a self-KeyGen, or a loader.


[ CONCLUSION ]

That's it. Have fun and feel free to ask any questions.
